# General Notes and Jupyter Notebooks for learning deeply

This repository is a dumpiong ground of notes, side projects, and jupyter notebooks used to explore deep learning.

AFAIK these are the main deep learning libraries:
- Tensorflow
  - Keras: Abstracted interface built on Tensorflow
- PyTorch
  - FastAI: Abstracted interface built on PyTorch
- MXNET (no clue...)

Things to explore:
- mlflow: https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/quickstart.html

Jupyter Notebooks (organized by dataset):
- PETS Dataset: (https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/)
  - FastAI_PETS_Playground.ipynb
  - FastAI_PETS_Cat_Dog_Classifier.ipynb
  - FastAI_PETS_SimilarCats_v1.ipynb
  - FastAI_PETS_SimilarCats_CAM.ipynb

Where I'm running:
- Google Colab
  - There are limits and I've been locked out for a day due to resource limits w/ the free version
- Local GPU
  - Nvidia GTX1070ti w/ 8GB Memory
